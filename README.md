# citrination-xray-scattering-integrator
An ingester (ingestor?) for the Citrination platform. 
Integrates a .tif image and produces a PIF record containing labeled intensity data.

The integration parameters are taken as input,
in the PONI (point of normal incidence) format,
as developed by ESRF's silx project 
(https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI).

The processing workflow is built on PAWS,
the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL
(https://github.com/slaclab/paws).
