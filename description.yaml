# This file describes the converter and its arguments to tell the driver how to construct the UI

## The first block gives the name, namespace, version, and description of the converter
name: citrination-xray-scattering-integrator
namespace: xray-scattering 
displayName: "X-ray scattering spectrum integrator"
version: auto 
description: Given a .tif image file and integration parameters, this ingester produces a PIF record containing integrated intensity data.

## Supported primitive types:
##  - String
##  - Boolean
##  - Integer
##  - Real (which is a float)
## There is also support for fixed-size lists with the form List[size][type] 
## Multidimensional lists are not currently supported
# defaults are only supported for required arguments
